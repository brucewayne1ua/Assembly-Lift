# Elevator System Based on Intel 8051 Microcontroller

This repository contains the code and virtual environment setup for a three-story elevator system based on the Intel 8051 microcontroller.

## Features

- **Three-Story Elevator**: Controls for moving the elevator between three floors.
- **Door Closure Sensors**: Ensures that the doors are closed before the elevator moves.
- **Start-Stop Button**: Allows users to start or stop the elevator operation.
- **Call Dispatcher Button**: Enables users to call for assistance from a dispatcher.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Intel 8051 Microcontroller
- Development environment for 8051 (such as Keil uVision)
- Hardware setup for elevator simulation (e.g., buttons, sensors, motors)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/brucewayne1ua/Assembly-Lift.git
    cd elevator-8051
    ```

2. Set up the development environment for Intel 8051:
    - Install Keil uVision or any other compatible IDE.
    - Open the project file in your IDE.

3. Compile and upload the code to your Intel 8051 microcontroller.


### Usage

1. Ensure the elevator system hardware is correctly set up and connected to the Intel 8051 microcontroller.
2. Upload the compiled code to the microcontroller.
3. Use the start-stop button to begin or halt elevator operations.
4. Use the floor buttons to select the desired floor.
5. If necessary, use the call dispatcher button to call for assistance.

### Virtual Environment

To simulate the elevator system, a virtual environment can be set up
